## General Info
The project was initialized to create a timed quiz about coding and web development. The quiz-taker needs to be timed while taking the quiz, and penalized for wrong answers with a deduction of time off of the timer. When the quiz is finished, the quiz-taker is directed to a screen to input their initials where they will be able to save their score. Once the score is saved, quiz-takers can view their scores among the top five high scores. They can clear the high scores for the next round of quizzing and re-take the quiz.
* The quiz begins when the Play button is clicked.
* The timer starts at the first question of the quiz.
* When a question is answered, another question automatically generates.
* If the answer to the question is incorrect, time is subtracted from the counter.
* Once the time hits zero, the game is over.
* The quiz-taker may save their initials and their scores.
* The scores can be viewed with a click of the high scores button.
